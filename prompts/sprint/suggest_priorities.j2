Based on the current sprint state, suggest priority adjustments.

Sprint: {{ sprint.name }}
Days Remaining: {{ sprint.days_remaining }}

Current Tickets:
{% for ticket in tickets %}
- {{ ticket.key }}: {{ ticket.summary | truncate(50) }}
  Type: {{ ticket.issue_type }} | Status: {{ ticket.status }} | Points: {{ ticket.story_points | default('?') }}
  {% if ticket.is_blocked %}⚠️ BLOCKED{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Sprint Goals: {{ sprint.goal | default('Not specified') }}

Constraints:
- Available capacity: ~{{ sprint.days_remaining * 6 }} hours
- Team velocity: {{ sprint.avg_historical_velocity | round(1) }} points/sprint

Analyze the tickets and suggest:
1. Which tickets MUST be completed this sprint?
2. Which could be moved to next sprint?
3. Any re-ordering for optimal flow?
